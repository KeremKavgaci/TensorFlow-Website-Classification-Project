# TensorFlow Website Classification Project

Classification of websites as malicious or non-malicious using Python and TensorFlow.

In this project, an artificial intelligence classification model was created by using the website data in the "maliciousornot.xlsx" excel file, taking into account a total of 19 parameters such as URL length, number of special characters, TCP conservation exchange, app bytes, source app packets. 

The project was coded in Python language and developed in the Jupyter notebook environment using the Tensorflow framework.
